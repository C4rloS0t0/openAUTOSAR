How to compile DaVinci/openAUTOSAR

The indications are for the only development environment currently supported:

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (we test the system on a VMWare virtual machine running on a MS Windows 10 host)

Please note that the indications below are valid for the current "master" branch.
For the details for different versions please refer to the README.md and INSTALL.txt
files in the distribution.

INSTALLATION
============

1. Download the package with the relevant release tag from the GitHub repository (if a zip file deflate it before progressing to next point)
   
2. You must have a folder with the content of the openAUTOSAR project
     
BUILD
=====

1. Software packages needed by openAUTOSAR 
   - install g++ if not yet avaulable ("sudo apt install g++" should be sufficient)
   - install CMake if not  yet available ("sudo apt install cmake" should be sufficient)
   - install Git if not  yet available ("sudo apt install git" should be sufficient)
2. Inside the openAUTOSAR create a "build" folder (this is the typical name of the folder where we are going to create the binaries for our package)
3. move inside the created folder
4. delete everything inside (of course, the first time the folder is going to be empty, but this should be done always for a clean build)
5. run 'cmake' to create the makefiles for the system
   the command is 
   
   cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=true ..

   -G "Unix Makefiles" : this tells CMake to generate makefiles in a Unix environment because we are using a linux host
   -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=true : this is optional, but convenient when setting up a development environent.
                                   Should anything go wrong with the compilation we can see the information from the compiler.
                                   Otherwise they are hidden bx CMake
    .. this indicates the folder where the "root" of the project is. Since we are currently in the 'build' subfolder, this indicated the parent 
       folder

6. run 'make' . This should be sufficient to call the compilation of the system
7. if everything is configured correctly all the available modules should compile successfully.
