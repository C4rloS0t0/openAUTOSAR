How to compile DaVinci/openAUTOSAR

The indiocations are for the only development environment currently supported:

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (we test the system on a VMWare virtual machine running on a MS Windows 10 host)

INSTALLATION
============

1. Install gcc-arm-none-eabi
Please note that since quite a while the only place where to download the toolcHain from is: 
https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/downloads

The only version with which the package has been configured and tested is availabl√∂e at 
https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu/11.2-2022.02/binrel/gcc-arm-11.2-2022.02-x86_64-arm-none-eabi.tar.xz

  - Download the package in a folder of your choice and the deflate it.
  - A folder called gcc-arm-11.2-2022.02-x86_64-arm-none-eabi should be visible
  - IMPORTANT: the build system currently expects this folder to be under /opt, therefore the folder has to be (simply) copied there 
               (e.g. using from a terminal a "sudo"ed" command like "sudo cp -R gcc-arm-11.2-2022.02-x86_64-arm-none-eabi /opt"),
               if not already there.

2. Download the package with the relevant release tag from the GitHub repository (if a zip file deflate it before progressing to next point)
   
3. You must have a folder with the content of the openAUTOSAR project
